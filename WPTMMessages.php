Simply create a test and BOOYA! â€“ you\'ve won the internet marketing lottery.</p><p>You\'ll instantly have a winning combination of headline, copy, and price that will deliver a windfall of sales and profits from your site, day in, day out.</p><p>So what\'s the difference between this and other testing plugins? Don\'t confuse the WP Test Monkey with basic split testing software. With those other plugins you have to laboriously create multiple versions of the same page for each test you want to run. This is the free version of WP Test Monkey which makes it drop-dead simple to test up to 2 elements - if you would like to test unlimited elements of your page at the same time, you can grab the premium version at the <a href=\'https://cz112.infusionsoft.com/go/wptm/wp/\'>WP Test Monkey website</a>.</p><p>Shall we get started?</p>',

Let\'s say you have 2 headlines you like and 2 different price points for your product. With this plugin you can test them all at the same time by showing a different and unique variation to each visitor.
